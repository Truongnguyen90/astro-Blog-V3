        <h3>Current Projects</h3>
        <p>As of December 2025, I'm actively working on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Residential Interior Design:</strong> Leading design for a modern minimalist apartment renovation in downtown area, focusing on space optimization and natural light.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Commercial Space:</strong> Conceptualizing a boutique café interior that blends industrial aesthetics with warm, inviting elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>This Blog:</strong> Building and personalizing this Astro-based blog to share design insights, productivity tips, and project showcases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3D Visualization:</strong> Improving my SketchUp and Blender skills for more realistic client presentations and virtual walkthroughs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Learning & Growth</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Exploring sustainable and eco-friendly materials for upcoming interior projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Experimenting with smart home integration in residential designs—finding the sweet spot between tech and aesthetics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Studying Japanese and Scandinavian design principles for inspiration on minimalism and functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optimizing my workflow with better project management tools and automation scripts.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Personal Focus</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Maintaining work-life balance by dedicating weekends to creative exploration outside of client work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Documenting my design process through photography and blog posts to build a comprehensive portfolio.
          </li>
          <li>
            Staying active through morning runs and yoga—essential for creativity and mental clarity.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Not Doing Right Now</h3>
        <p>
          To maintain focus and quality, I'm intentionally not:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Taking on more than 2-3 concurrent design projects to ensure each client gets my full attention.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chasing design trends that don't align with timeless, functional aesthetics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Over-committing to social media—I share when inspired, not on a forced schedule.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This page reflects my current priorities. I update it every few months as my focus evolves.
