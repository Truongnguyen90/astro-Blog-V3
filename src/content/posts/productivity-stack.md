As an interior designer who values efficiency, I've curated a tech stack that helps me stay organized and productive. Here's what I use daily.

## Design & Creative Work

These are my go-to tools for the actual design work:

- **3D Modeling Software**: Essential for visualizing spaces and presenting concepts to clients
- **Digital Drawing Tools**: For quick sketches and ideation
- **Photo Editing**: Processing project photos and creating presentations
- **Color Management**: Tools for palette development and color matching

## Project Management

Keeping track of multiple projects requires solid systems:

- **Task Management**: Breaking down projects into actionable steps
- **Time Tracking**: Understanding where my time goes
- **Client Communication**: Centralized platforms for updates and approvals
- **File Organization**: Cloud storage with smart folder structures

## Productivity & Focus

Staying focused in a distraction-filled world:

- **Note-Taking**: Quick capture of ideas and meeting notes
- **Calendar Management**: Scheduling and time blocking
- **Focus Tools**: Apps that help maintain deep work sessions
- **Automation**: Scripts and shortcuts for repetitive tasks

## Communication & Collaboration

Working with clients and contractors:

- **Video Conferencing**: For remote consultations
- **Team Chat**: Quick coordination with contractors
- **Email Management**: Keeping inbox organized
- **Document Sharing**: Collaborative file access

## The Workflow

My typical day involves:

1. Morning review of tasks and calendar
2. Focused design work in time blocks
3. Client meetings and check-ins
4. Administrative tasks batched together
5. End-of-day planning for tomorrow

## Key Principles

What makes this stack work:

- **Simplicity**: Only tools I actually use daily
- **Integration**: Services that work together
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to different project needs
- **Reliability**: Stable, well-maintained software

## Continuous Optimization

I regularly evaluate and adjust my tools. What works today might not work tomorrow, and that's okay. The goal is continuous improvement, not perfection.

Check out my [Tools & Software](/stack) page for the complete list with specific recommendations.
