## Background

I created PricingPatterns.com because I saw a gap in the resources available for pricing page designs. After working on several digital projects, I noticed there weren’t many places to get inspiration or see how different companies organize their pricing. I wanted to build a site that would make it easier for people to create effective pricing pages by showing them real examples.

## The Platform

- **Pricing Tiers:** sort by tier, and see how others structure their pricing pages, including:
- **Style** - Sort by different pricing styles used by businesses
- **Color Scheme** - Sort by different color schemes
- **Tag** - Sort by different tags
- **Category** - Sort by different categories

## Impact

Since launching, PricingPatterns.com has helped a lot of people create better pricing pages. It’s become a go-to spot for:

- **Inspiration:** Find fresh, creative ideas for your pricing page.
- **Efficiency:** Save time by seeing what’s working for others.
